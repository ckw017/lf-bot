# lf-bot
An email bot that notifies the user whenever new items have been added to the UC Berkeley Lost and Found. The bot automatically detects updates to UCPD's lost and found pdf, parses the data, and reorganizes it into a json object.

Up-to-date data is synced with a firebase database, and displayed on the [interative webpage](https://ckw017.github.io/berkeley-lf-page/).
